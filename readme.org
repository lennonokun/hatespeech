* about

This project hopes to test and compare multi-task learning and modular
learning methods on the problem of hatespeech
classification. Currently the datasets of interest are the Hatexplain
and Measuring Hatespeech datasets. I specifically hope to compare
merging/fusing separately trained adapters with singly trained
multi-task adapters.

RESULTS
- it seems as if merged model is comparable to multiple subtasks
  models and better than a singly trained model
- make sure this isnt a result of too early stopping

* notes
- could pre train adapter on much much larger non labeled corpus
  (language adapters)
- there seems to be evidence that at least merging partitioned targets
  improves metrics
- todo try longer encoder warmups, larger models, fusion, multi
  dataset, other tasks
- todo parallel, but probably they should not be trainable

** limitations
- AutoAdapterModel cannot do quantized LoRA TODO check
- adapters.init(AutoModel) cannot do custom heads

** quantization
- do not use Trainer(precision=...) ???
- peft has better support, but much less flexible otherwise
  - lora vars work as fp32
- adapters has worse support
  - lora vars need to match AutoModel's torch_dtype
  - can fix by manually changing, seems to maybe minorly affect metrics?
- currently heads are still float32, but probably worth it for stability

** compilation
- maybe worth it???
- ~10% speed increase
- yet to try on base-discriminator

** model size
- larger model greatly improves target f1
- comparable label f1 

** else
- rationale seems to get stuck at 0.6 f1?
- warm up heads esp when fusing/merging
- probably heads should have their own learning rate?
- more params necessary for target
- fully separate targets? 
- why is the adapter fusion 2.4M params

* todo

** ideas
- TASKS SHOULD MOSTLY JUST BE DATASET + NAME, PUT REST IN HEAD?
- restructure like lightning-hydra-zen-template
- add PreTrainedModel to custom types?
- separate heads loss + metrics ? (loss could go to mtlloss?)
- re-add task-combined dataset for mtllora? (but it performed much more poorly)
- make sure WeightedSampling good
- make HateDatasets something before HateDataModule?
- just one paths/info config instead of stats + datasetinfo

** short-term
- saving + loading also for full?
- allow for multiple adapters to be used at same time?
- improve modeling/methods.py:adjust_dtypes (classvar for each method?)
- smaller partitions?
- re-add head warmup for merging
- re-add target-specific metrics
- target-specific loss currently just index of mask, not corresponding
  to actual targets
- eval during validation / test?
- re-add VAT + gradnorm, check if worth
- fixed step epochs with equal sampling from datasets?
- separate data loading into its own module
- update readme papers + datasets

** medium-term
- try more virtual adversarial training
- try label smoothing?
- attention mechanism with rationales?
- rationales mask including not classifying invalid tokens

** long term
- text augmentation
- use hatebase for lexicon features
