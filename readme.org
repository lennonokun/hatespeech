* todo

- augmentation with constraints to not modify reasonings
- multiple datasets?
- augmentation training method?
  - randomized vs total?
  - if randomized, custom dataloader
- try label smoothing?
- make offensive label just normal to focus on hatespeech?
- attention mechanism with rationales?

- use hatebase for lexicon features
- dataset combination
  - include dataset origin as input?
  - ^ could fuzzify it so that it works for general also
  - ^ could use TaBERT or use as input in classification head
